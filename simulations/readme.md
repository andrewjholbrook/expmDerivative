## Rproject
For file path sanity and such in the R scripts, use the Rproject for all R scripts.

## Notes on generating the simulation XMLS
Steps

1. Choose states to condense (if any) or discard
2. Run condensing script to generate an XML capable of analyzing the original data on a condensed state-space and make sure it runs
3. From (2), make piBUSS simulation XML
4. Simulate from (3)
5. Using XML from (2) as a template, insert data generated by step (4)
6. Run XML from 5


## Files and such
`simulations/src` contains scripts to run the above steps.
- `condenseStates.R` handles steps 1+2.
- `makePiBUSS.R` handles step 3.

`simulations/original` holds a slightly simplified copy of the main analysis XML to use as a template for generating analyses of simulated data.
`simulations/condensed_original` holds versions of the XML in `simulations/original` with the state-spaces made smaller (these will not run, they are useful only as templates)
