## Running analyses of simulated data
Running the analyses of simulated data requires a number of steps.

1. Choose states to condense (if any) or discard (e.g. only locations in China, or combining all non-Hubei China locations).
2. Run condensing script to generate an XML capable of analyzing the original data on a condensed state-space (it won't run, but it's an important template).
3. From (2), make piBUSS simulation XML.
4. Simulate from (3).
5. Using XML from (2) as a template, insert data generated by step (4).
6. Run XML from 5 in BEAST.


## Files and such
`simulations/src` contains scripts to run the above steps.
- `condenseStates.R` handles steps 1+2.
- `makePiBUSS.R` handles step 3.
- `makeAnalysisXMLs.R` handles steps 4+5.

`simulations/original` holds a slightly simplified copy of the main analysis XML to use as a template for generating analyses of simulated data.

`simulations/condensed_original` holds versions of the XML in `simulations/original` with the state-spaces made smaller (these will not run, they are useful only as templates)
